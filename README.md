# computer-vision-edge-detection-hough-transform
A Computer Vision project implementing key techniques: gradient-based edge detection, Harris corner detection, and Hough Transform for detecting lines and circles. Includes custom algorithms for edge, boundary, and shape detection to provide hands-on experience with image processing fundamentals.

## Introduction
This README provides step-by-step instructions for running the Project code on Local Server.

## Prerequisites
- An internet connection
- The image files are in the same folder as the .py file.
- VS Code

## Steps to Run the Code on Local Server***

### 1. Access Command Prompt / VS Code / Terminal
1. Make sure Python is installed on your system or go to Google and download & install Python.
2. Use the Python --version command in Terminal to check if it's properly installed on your system.
3. Open any of the above in the folder where the provided .py file and image are located.
4. Just run the following command: python filename.py and press Enter.

## Structure of Code
    q1_part1: Problem 1 - 1
    q1_part2: Problem 1 - 2
    q2:       Problem 2
    q3_sub1:  Problem 3 - 1
    q3_sub2:  Problem 3 - 2

## Troubleshooting
- If you encounter an error about missing libraries, add the following at the beginning of your code and run it:
  ```python
  !pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-image Scipy
  ```
- ***In Problem 1 - Subproblem 2 Boundary detection you have to click on the edges of the objects in the image to see the results.
- ***The subproblem 2 in the problem 3 takes lot of time to run depending how powerful is the system. It took almost 45min on mine!
- ***I have also added the output image for this Problem 3 Subproblem 2.

## Conclusion
By following these steps, you should be able to successfully run this project code on Local Server.
